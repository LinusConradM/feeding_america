title: "gp-food-basket: Complete Team Development Guide"
format: html
---

This guide provides all instructions for setup, version control, development, testing, and deployment of the **gp-food-basket** Shiny application. Every team member is encouraged to follow these steps exactly to ensure consistent, collaborative progress.

The **gp-food-basket** project is a modular R Shiny dashboard for analyzing and visualizing U.S. food insecurity data. It is structured for team-based collaboration using Git branches. Each contributor works on their own feature branch and merges tested code into the development (`dev`) branch before final deployment to `main`.

## 1. Environment Setup

### 1.1 Install Prerequisites

* R version 4.3 or later
* RStudio or Positron IDE
* Git installed and configured with your GitHub account

### 1.2 Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-org-or-username>/gp-food-basket.git
cd gp-food-basket

### 1.3 Open the Project

Open `gp-food-basket.Rproj` in RStudio or Positron.
Ensure the working directory points to the project root (the same folder that contains `app.R`).

### 1.4 Install Dependencies

Run this in the R console:

source("global.R")

This loads and installs all required packages:
`shiny`, `plotly`, `leaflet`, `tidyverse`, `DT`, and `bslib`.

## 2. Project Structure

````text
gp-food-basket/
├── app.R                   # Main app entry point
├── global.R                # Loads packages and global settings
├── R/                      # Modular components
│   ├── ui_overview.R
│   ├── server_overview.R
│   ├── ui_exploration.R
│   ├── server_exploration.R
│   ├── ui_analysis.R
│   ├── server_analysis.R
│   ├── helpers.R
│   └── load_all_modules.R

├── vignette/               # Documentation and notes
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── gp-food-basket.Rproj
````

Each module contains two files — one for the user interface (`ui_*.R`) and one for server logic (`server_*.R`).
Shared functions live in `helpers.R`.
The main `app.R` loads and runs everything.

## 3. Git Branch Structure

| Branch                           | Description                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **main**                         | Stable, production-ready version            |
| **dev**                          | Integration branch for testing new features |
| **feature/exploration-visuals**  | Map and trend visualizations                |
| **feature/analysis-correlation** | Regression and correlation modeling         |
| **feature/data-cleaning-ui**     | Data upload and transformation              |
| **feature/modeling-validation**  | Model validation and diagnostics            |
| **project_plan**                 | Documentation and planning materials        |

## 4. Daily Development Workflow

### Step 1: Update your local repository

git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

### Step 2: Switch to your assigned branch

git checkout feature/exploration-visuals

### Step 3: Edit your files

Work only on your assigned section:

* **Overview Tab** – edit `R/ui_overview.R` and `R/server_overview.R`
* **Exploration Tab** – edit `R/ui_exploration.R` and `R/server_exploration.R`
* **Analysis Tab** – edit `R/ui_analysis.R` and `R/server_analysis.R`
* **Data Cleaning** – edit `R/helpers.R`, `data/`, or `data_raw/`
* **Documentation** – update `vignette/` or `project_plan/`

### Step 4: Run and test the app

In R:

`shiny::runApp(".")`

The app must start with no errors, and your tab should work as expected.

### Step 5: Commit your work

git add R/ui_exploration.R R/server_exploration.R
git commit -m "Added leaflet map and summary table to Exploration tab"

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

git push origin feature/exploration-visuals

### Step 7: Open a Pull Request

1. Open GitHub in your browser.
2. Click **“Compare & Pull Request”**.
3. Create a PR into **dev**, never directly into **main**.
4. Add a clear title and short description of your changes.
5. Request review from the Project teammate.
6. After testing, the reviewer merges into `dev`.
7. Once `dev` is stable, it is merged into `main` for deployment.

## 5. Coding Standards

### 5.1 General Rules

* Use `package::function()` syntax:
  plotly::plotlyOutput("chart_id")
  leaflet::renderLeaflet({...})
  DT::DTOutput("table_id")
* Keep **UI** and **Server** logic separate.
* Avoid hard-coded paths — use `here::here("data", "file.csv")`.
* Write **meaningful commit messages**:
  Added regression results to Analysis tab

### 5.2 Testing Before Commit

Always confirm the app runs successfully:
`shiny::runApp(".")`

Never commit raw or large files; keep them under `data_raw/` (ignored by Git).

## 6. .gitignore Rules

Add this at the project root:

.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
.Rproj.user/
rsconnect/
data/*.rds
data/*.csv
data_raw/
*.DS_Store

This prevents temporary or large files from being tracked in Git.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                                | Cause                        | Solution                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| could not find function "plotlyOutput" | Function not namespaced      | Use `plotly::plotlyOutput()`         |
| App won’t start                        | Missing comma or parenthesis | Check syntax in `ui_*.R`             |
| Shiny won’t stop                       | App running in terminal      | Press **Ctrl + C** or click **Stop** |
| Merge conflict                         | Branch outdated              | Run `git pull origin dev --rebase`   |
| Missing packages                       | New environment              | Re-run `source("global.R")`          |

## 8. Testing and Code Review

Before submitting any Pull Request:

1. Run the app locally with `shiny::runApp(".")`.
2. Confirm your tab loads and updates correctly.
3. Verify no console errors appear.
4. Commit only tested, clean code.
5. Request a peer review before merging.

## 9. Deployment Procedure

When the app is stable on the `main` branch:

rsconnect::deployApp(appDir = ".", appName = "gp-food-basket")

You may deploy via:

* **ShinyApps.io**
* **Posit Connect**
* **Internal servers**

Ensure all dependencies are declared in `global.R`.
